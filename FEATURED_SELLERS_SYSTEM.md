# Featured Sellers Management System

## 🎯 Overview

The Featured Sellers system allows admins to promote users/sellers to featured status, making their products, services, and farms appear prominently on the home page of the main FUD application.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### **Featured Sellers Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE featured_sellers (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    featured_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    featured_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    priority INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
